This is a breadboard breakout for the Analog Discovery 2â„¢ from Digitlent. Please don't sue me I just wanted to make my own version for cheap and share it with others.

I ordered my boards from JLC PCB with their 5 2 Layer Boards for $2.

I also ordered the headers from LCSC 
Male Header Part #: C124373
