This is a breadboard breakout for the Analog Discovery 2â„¢ from Digitlent. Please don't sue me I just wanted to make my own version for cheap and share it with others.

I ordered my boards from JLC PCB with their 5 2 Layer Boards for $2. (I'll post pictures once I get the boards in)

I also ordered the headers from LCSC 

Male Header Part #: C124373

Female Header Part #: C124408

(I have't verified that these work yet)
